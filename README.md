[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a platform that helps you train and improve your coding skills by solving katas (programming tasks or challenges) of many types and difficulty levels. Users can view solutions of other people after they manage to solve the kata or unlock them. After a kata is solved, users can cast their satisfaction vote for a kata to let others know how they like it.

## What is Kata?
On Codewars, kata are code challenges that vary in difficulty (from simple fundamentals to complex problem solving). 

>The term [Kata] was first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer as an acknowledgment to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. Dave's version of the concept defines a code kata as an exercise in programming which helps a programmer sharpen their skills through practice and repetition.

### Progression
- :shield: RANK
  - Your rank is determined by current  proficiency and your kyu/dan level. 
  - You can level up by solving challenges (kata).
  - Levels of difficulty, from easy to hard: 8 Kyu, 7 Kyu, 6 Kyu, 5 Kyu, 4 Kyu, 3 Kyu, 2 Kyu, 1 Kyu (then onto master level <i>Dan</i>)
      
- :handshake: HONOR
  - Your honor points represent how active the user is. Honor can be earned by completing kata, translating them, voting, and many other ways.

Rank Name lingo:
>Why the names Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu (or KyÅ«) indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward. Black belts in martial arts are Dan level.
